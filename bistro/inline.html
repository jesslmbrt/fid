<h1>Low and Slow</h1> 
<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new 
cooking technique called <dfn>sous vide</dfn>.</p>
<p>In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed 
in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon 
with Dill Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef 
table, contact us <em>before</em> <time datetime="2016-11-30">November 30.</time></p>

pasteurized</b></u>. <i>Avoid it if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</i></small></p>
